## My Father


### My father, Jerry, was in Vietnam and was a Dog Handler.

### Kat (Alexxander in the Father's Day Pic from the kids) made this picture of my father with his artistic talent. I seriously have no idea how he did this, but I love it and appreciate the time and effort he took in creating it!  Looks very simular to the abover picture doesn't it???

### In Paris, Tx, they made a vertrans memerial for Vietnam, and my father was asked it he would be a model and technical advisor for a statue that was going to be created and displayed at the memorial.
