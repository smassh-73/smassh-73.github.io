This is a family website that includes things we love in our family.


A few of the things we love is to play EverQuest2 with our family and we also love our fur babies (our mousers and our hamsters)

This is a colection of pics of our fur babies and our favorite game (EverQuest2):


You can check out EverQuest2 here. The game is actually free to play  [Ever Quest2][ever-quest] 

You can also download a map for the game here  [Game Map][game-map].

And a Parser (to see how much damage you have done) [Game Parser][game-parser].

And there is even a differnt GUI if you do not like the original one that comes with the game.  This one has more customization [Darq-UI][darq-ui]
